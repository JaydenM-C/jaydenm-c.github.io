I am a linguist and visiting scholar at the [Surrey Morphology Group](https://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/), University of Surrey, and I'm interested in how languages evolve through space and time. From 2022-2025, I was a Lecturer in Linguistics at the University of Newcastle, Australia. My expertise includes phonology (sound systems), morphology (word structure) and the Indigenous languages of Australia and New Guinea.

## Research

I'm currently affiliated with two projects. The first is [EVOGRAM](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-20-CE27-0021), investigating the linguistic and non-linguistic (e.g. cultural, environmental) factors driving the evolution of nominal classification systems (i.e. how languages classify nouns by marking gender or using [classifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifier_(linguistics))). This is a continuation of my recent postdoctoral work at the [Laboratoire Dynamique Du Langage](http://www.ddl.cnrs.fr/index.asp?Langue=EN&) (Dynamics of Language Lab, a.k.a. DDL), CNRS, Université Lyon 2. The second is [OzSpace](https://ozspace.org/), which is investigating the interaction of landscape, culture and social diversity on spatial language systems in Australian Indigenous languages.

More generally, I'm interested in expanding coverage of under-resourced languages in the computational language sciences. This can improve accessibility of speech and language technologies to under-served linguistic communities. Studying a broad cross-section of the globe's linguistic diversity is also crucial for answering some of the biggest questions in linguistics and human history.

I completed my PhD at The University of Queensland, Australia. My thesis, [_Phonotactics in historical linguistics: Quantitative interrogation of a novel data source_](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9d9e8be), is available (open access) on [UQ eSpace](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9d9e8be). Some of the chapters have also been published separately as journal articles (see my [Publications](publications.md)).

## Data science

My skills cover the full data science pipeline, including data curation, methodological design, advanced statistical programming in R and other software, technical reporting, visualisation and presentation. I have project management experience, including winning grant funding, managing teams of research assistants and publishing in leading international journals.
